Farseer Physics compiled as a portable class library (PCL) against the PCL version of MonoGame.

This is a fork of the Farseer Physics Engine found on codeplex with a few minor changes to make it work as a Portable Class Library (PCL) with the PCL version of MonoGame. It is provided under the same Microsoft Permissive License (Ms-PL) v1.1 (Ms-PL) as the original source code.
